stuff to do still:


1. Start working on specific cards
 - attack (done, but debug still needed: when you play the attack, it gives you two turns as well as the next person)
 - Nope (needa figure out how to make someone be able to play a nope card at any time)
 - Favor (NEEDS TOTAL COMPLETION - 1. figure out how to choose who you want the card from 2. how to make it so that the player can pick a card 3. using the value system, make the computer figure out how to pick a card)
 - Finish see the future (needs to implement, the code is already in App.java)
 - shuffle (do shuffle so that the decks array is rearranged)

 2. Fix deck and end graphics
 - when the deck runs out of cards, you can still draw just nothing happens
 - make a animation for the death scene if you dont have a defuse
 - perhaps include more exploding kittens because they are kinda rare
 - code end scene so that something happens
 - what if the computer explodes, how does the visual change

 3. include a instruction page...?

 4. Polish graphics cause they are kinda plain
